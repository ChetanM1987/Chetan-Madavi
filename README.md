Loan Approval Prediction Project using Machine Learning
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a loan application should be approved or not based on various features provided in the dataset. It utilizes Python programming language along with popular data analysis and machine learning libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the machine learning model.
Jupyter notebooks are stored in this directory, showcasing the data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation steps.
